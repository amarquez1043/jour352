    <p>Since 2018, students across the country have been waiting with baited breath for President Donald Trump’s administration to enter their <a href= "https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title-ix-nprm.pdf" target= "_blank">proposed changes</a> to the Title IX guidelines on campus sexual assault into the Federal Register, where they’ll be enshrined into federal law for the forseeable future.</p>
    <p>“We are not going to accept this,” Mikaela Davenport, a former student government legislator at the University of Maryland, told <a href= "http://www.dbknews.com/2018/12/07/betsy-devos-title-ix-guidelines-sexual-assault-investigation-education-umd-sga-ocrsm/" target= "_blank">The Diamondback</a> in the weeks after the proposed changes were released.</p>
    <p>Since then, the final guidelines have not been released, but beginning in January 2020, activists, reporters and social justice groups have expected the changes to drop at almost any moment.</p>
    <p>In a piece published on January 15 in <a href= "https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/01/15/how-respond-new-federal-title-ix-regulations-being-published-soon-opinion" target= "_blank">Inside Higher Ed</a>, Brett Sokolow, the president of the Association of Title IX Administrators anticipated that the final version of the regulations would be announced “within the coming weeks.”</p>
    <p>In a February 18 <a href= "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/02/18/title-ix-debate-complicates-push-higher-education-act-reauthorization" target= "_blank">Inside Higher Ed</a> article about negotiations to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, reporter Kery Murakami predicted the final changes would be announced “in the coming days.”</p>
    <p>Title IX guidelines on sexual assault dictate how universities and other federally funded entities across the U.S. deal with sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations. The 1972 Title IX law that mandated gender equality in all federally-funded institutions allows the federal government to make recommended changes to the enforcement of these guidelines.</p>
    <p>In 2011, the Obama administration released a <a href= "https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf" target= "_blank">Dear Colleague letter</a> outlining new regulations pertaining to university investigation of sexual misconduct, which allowed for a lower preponderance of evidence to convict a student of sexual misconduct.</p>

    <p>In 2017, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a Trump appointee, rescinded the 2011 letter and in November 2018, her office announced rules of their own that they hoped to enshrine in the Federal Register as law for all federally-funded institutions.</p>
    <p>The most notable changes to the Title IX rules proposed in 2018 are that a student accused of sexual assault would have the opportunity to cross-examine their accuser, colleges would only be allowed to investigate allegations of misconduct that occured on-campus or in university-sponsored educational programs and the definition of sexual assault that colleges are required to investigate would be narrower than Obama-era guidelines.
      The change that has drawn the most public comment is the one that allows for students accused of sexual assault or misconduct to cross-examine their accusers.</p>
    <p>Cynthia Garrett, a lawyer and leader of an advocacy group called Families Advocating for Campus Equality, told the <a href= "https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-You-Need-to-Know-About/245118" target= "_blank">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> that cross-examination allows for a real-time reaction from victims, allowing for inconsistencies in testimony to come to light if they exist.</p>
    <p>But, others say that the threat of cross-examinations would discourage victims from reporting assaults and that cross-examinations give unnecessary power to assailants.</p>
    <p>Cross examinations “could affect the willingness of people to report sexual assault, if they picture themselves in a courtroom being yelled at about their sexual history the way you see on TV shows,” Jeffery J. Nolan, a lawyer who advises colleges on Title IX issues, <a href= "https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-You-Need-to-Know-About/245118" target= "_blank">told the</a> Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
    <p>“Rape is about power and control and not about sexual desire. Therefore, it is a bad idea to give the person with the power even more power to intimidate and hurt the victim,” Colby Bruno, senior legal counsel for the Victim Rights Law Center, <a href= "https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-You-Need-to-Know-About/245118" target= "_blank">told the Chronicle</a>.</p>
    <p>At the University of Maryland, there is major opposition to these proposed changes, too. In 2018, the Student Government Association <a href="http://www.dbknews.com/2018/12/07/betsy-devos-title-ix-guidelines-sexual-assault-investigation-education-umd-sga-ocrsm/" target= "_blank">passed a resolution</a> opposing a majority of the proposed changes in the DeVos’ plan.</p>
    <p>“We just think that in its totality, these harmful aspects could make survivors less likely to report their experiences, and less likely to get justice in the long run,” Julia Novick, the SGA’s director of sexual misconduct prevention, <a href= "http://www.dbknews.com/2018/12/07/betsy-devos-title-ix-guidelines-sexual-assault-investigation-education-umd-sga-ocrsm/" target= "_blank">told The Diamondback</a> at the time.</p>
    <p>According <a href="https://www.ocrsm.umd.edu/files/OCRSM_Report_2018.pdf" target="_blank">to data</a> from the University of Maryland’s Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), the number of reports of sexual misconduct are rising steadily at the university.</p>
    <div class= "chart">
      <iframe title="UMD Sexual Misconduct Reports, Complaints and Investigations" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/czvuE/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="400" height="600"></iframe>
      <iframe title="Types of Complaints Received by UMD OCRSM" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aRPQ2/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="350" height="600"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>In the 2015-2016 school year, there were 184 reports of sexual misconduct and in the 2016-2017 school year, there were 208 reports of sexual misconduct. In the 2017-2018 school year, the most recent for which there is data available, there were 249 reports of sexual misconduct, and 91 complaints of sexual misconduct.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href= "https://www.ocrsm.umd.edu/files/OCRSM_Report_2018.pdf" target= "_blank">OCRSM data</a>, a report is a “potential complaint of sexual misconduct received by OCRSM” and a complaint is “when a student engages the university to address sexual misconduct.”</p>
    <p>Of the 91 complaints of sexual misconduct filed in the 2017-2018 school year,  46 of them were alleged sexual assaults. And, of those 91 complaints, 27 occurred off-campus. Under DeVos’ proposed rules, the OCRSM at the University of Maryland would not be obligated to investigate the reports of misconduct that occurred off-campus.</p>
      <div class= "chart">
      </div>
    <p>The University of Maryland has issued no guidance, so far, on how the proposed Title IX changes will impact their reporting and investigation practices, though as late as the fall 2019 semester, the OCRSM was <a href= "https://dbknews.com/2019/08/14/umd-title-ix-ocrsm-five-vacancies/" target= "_blank">severely understaffed</a>.</p>
    <p>Student body president Ireland Lesley pointed to the imminent changes to federal Title IX policy and to the office’s understaffing as major concerns for students.</p>
    <p>In August 2019, she told The Diamondback, “At the end of the day, the people who are going to be impacted is the students. It’s hard for us to wait for an office or department to get back on its feet.”</p>
